Date: 1/22/26 — Subject: Team setup and repos

This week we got into our groups and spent some time getting to know each other, which ended up being really helpful later on. We worked together on the square tangram activity, and it turned into a good lesson on communication. At first it was kind of messy, but we learned pretty quickly that being clear and working through ideas together makes a big difference.

Later in the week we set up our team GitHub repositories, and that part was a bit rough at the beginning. We ran into some confusion getting everything connected and figuring out how repos actually work, but after some trial and error we were able to get things running. By the end it made more sense, and hopefully by the end of the semester we’ll be way more comfortable with Git and maybe even feel like actual Git experts.

Date: 1/25/26 - Subject: Brainstorming

This week we decided what our group project would be. We came up with many ideas of what type of social media people would enjoy. Some things we talked about are location, music, activities, photobooths, clothes, sports, etc. We had the idea that maybe people wanted to share their current favorite outfits or clothing items. So we came up with an idea of a platform to do so or even sell your clothes there. The activities app was more focused on plans going on in the user's area. At times some want to go out and participate in events so an app where companies get to post event going on that week would be useful. We all like music a lot and thought that we could make an app that consisted on sharing a wrap of our most listened songs during a week, also a place where new artits can share their music. 

all of our ideas are very creative and the thought process was actually pretty fun, we laughed and enjoyed brainstorming. 

Date 2/6/2026 - Subject: User stories

After a lot of thougth and what out platforms could look like and our different ideas, we ended up deciding on the journal app. We came up with the name of the app: Seventh, since we decided that the main objective of this social media is to reflect on thoughts throughout the week and share their stories at the end of that week, on the seventh day, Sunday. We wanted to make an app that would be more slowed pace, not the immediate scroll and dopamine. This app is for those who want to take a step back and dedicate some time to themselves apart from the monotone routines of their daily life. 

Once we decided on the app, then we created our user stories. These were features that we imagined the platform should have, so pretending to be the user, seeing it from their point of view. We wrote down about 15 ideas so far. These features will are just a few things we want the app to have, but I'm sure that as we move on forward we'll come up with more things to add and improve as we grow in this process.
